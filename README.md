# Todo App
This project is a simple Todo application built with React. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new ones, marking them as completed, and deleting them. The app also features tab navigation to filter tasks based on their status (All, Open, Completed), and it persists data in the browser's localStorage for a consistent user experience.

## Features
- Add tasks: Users can add new tasks via an input field.
- Complete tasks: Tasks can be marked as done, which moves them to the "Completed" section.
- Delete tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list.
- Tab navigation: Filter tasks by their status (All, Open, Completed).
- Data persistence: Uses localStorage to persist tasks across page reloads.
